# TicTacToe

This game features a human player X and a computer player O that generates random moves. Both implement the Strategy interface. 
The Board class manages the state of the game and the game ends when GameCheck finds a winner. 

To run from command line:
```bash
$ cd TicTacToe
$ javac src/game/*.java
$ java -cp src game.Main
```
